          <h2><b>Goal:</b> Provide weightlifters with hands-off workout tracking at the gym.</h2>
		  <h3>CHALLENGE</h3>
          <p class="entry-content">Runners have enjoyed the fluid fitness experience with applications  where they just enter a few pieces of information and it passively tracks your workout, but that fluidity of tracking doesn't exist for weight lifting. <b>Our goal with Reps was to make tracking your weight lifting exercises as seamless of a task as possible.</b></p>
          <p>Existing weight lifting applications require you to manually insert all of your sets and reps, and don't provide a simple rest tracker. When you're exercising, you don't want to constantly be checking the clock, or having to enter every single rep and set. <b>You want to focus on the exercise.</p>
          <div class="video-wrapper">
            <iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/127445265" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe>
          </div>
          <p class="entry-content">Reps automatically tracks your exercises as you're doing them. You tell it what exercise you're doing, and it can detect each rep you do and add it to your total. Then with a tap on the phone held in your armband or pocket, you automatically enter into your rest period so you know exactly how long you have before your next set. As soon as it's time for your next set, Reps lets you know.</p>
          <h3>PROTOTYPES</h3>
          <p class="entry-content">After conducting needs finding via market research, eight user interviews, and a survey that received over 250 responses, we learned that there was a need for a weight lifting application that did not require constant manual input.</p>
          <p>From this information, we created a persona, Abby, and thought of the different use cases she would encounter during a workout at the gym: (1) Abby would want to be able to track her sets and reps in a way that didn't require manual input at every step, (2) Abby understands that rest time between sets is important and is concerned about resting for the appropriate amount of time, and (3) Abby tracks all her information for the purpose of making progress in her fitness goals and wishes to keep a history of her workouts. From these use cases, we began sketching screens that Abby might see.</p>

            <img class="entry-image" src="img/reps/slider_1_paper.png" title="Paper prototypes were clunky with the full workout and motivational messages displayed.">
            <img class="entry-image" src="img/reps/slider_2_midfi.png" title="Mid-Fi prototypes were slightly more refined and removed motivational messages.">
            <img class="entry-image" src="img/reps/slider_3_hifi.png" title="Our high-fidelity prototype was used to provide assets for our final design.">
          </div>
          
          <p class="entry-content">We proceeded to prototype our mobile application and test with users through a paper prototype, two iterations of a mid-fi prototype in Keynote, and a high-fidelity prototype using screens created in Photoshop and made interactive in <a href="http://invis.io/JV2OWZZCZ">Invision</a>.</p>
          
          <div class="entry-content"><img class="entry-image" src="img/reps/design.png"></div>
          
          <p class="entry-content">We began experimenting with colors, fonts, and logos that communicated the purpose of our application and appealed to our audience in our high-fidelity prototype. Through each iteration and round of user testing, we began simplifying the screen and removing unneeded clutter.</p>
          
          <h3>OUTCOME</h3>
          <p class="entry-content"><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.dhcs.reps" target="_blank"><img src="img/googleplay.png" width="25" style="float:left; margin-right:10px; margin-top:5px;"/></a>Our team launched the application to the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.dhcs.reps" target="_blank">Google Play Store</a>, and it provides the features of automated rep tracking, rest timing, and progress viewing.</p>
          
          <p class="entry-content">If we were able to spend more time working on the project, there are a few design and technical goals we would want to fulfill in order to further enhance the user experience:
            <ol>
              <li class="entry-content"><i>Better visualization of progress.</i> The current progress view is a list view, as we had trouble thinking of how to visualize progress. When there are more than two variables to consider, it doesn't make sense to use a graph. We would need to brainstorm more on this.<br /></li>
              <li class="entry-content"><i>Emphasis on graphics.</i> By adding fun elements to mundane objects like a small animation to the rest timer or to progress bars, the application would be more appealing from a visual perspective.<br /></li>
              <li class="entry-content"><i>Increased exercise options.</i> The current algorithm tracks any type of motion. Hence, in later versions of Reps, the user can enter a custom exercise (such as crunches, chest supported row, etc.) and will not be limited to the current three options of benchpress, deadlift, and squat.<br /></li>
              <li class="entry-content"><i>Rest Time Cues.</i> The user receives a certain cue, such as vibration or a beep, when the rest time ends. The summary of his workout will be displayed after they completes a workout.</li>
            </ol>
