          <h3>CHALLENGE</h3>
          <p class="entry-content">Our client, <a href="http://www.sapientnitro.com/" target="_blank">SapientNitro</a>, challenged our team to envision a new food delivery, shopping, preparation, or consumption services that leverages data from separate service ecosystems into our own service or platform.</p>
          <p class="entry-content">Health complications can often be remedied by a change in diet, and patients only see their doctor yearly for check-ups. After the trip to the office, there is nothing holding patients accountable to change their eating habits. Our goal with Digestible was to keep track of grocery and restaurants receipts and sync them eith existing nutrition and fitness applications along with updating the patient's health record that their doctor can see. <b>We aimed to create a service that keeps your doctor in the loop on your health all year and keeps patients accountable for their diets.</b></p>

          <h3>CONCEPT EVALUATION</h3>
          <p class="entry-content">Our team started with a concept map revolving around food, which allowed us to recognize different topics for research and exploration, such as social pressures, affordability, quality, and convenience. After a bit of Google-fu on the current situation and future states of ideas and discussion on the possibilities behind each, we decided to focus on creating a service that would change the current model of food education. <b>We wanted to provide a solution to childhood obesity</b></p>
          <div class="entry-content"><img class="entry-image" src="img/digestible/conceptmap.JPG" /></div>
          <p class="entry-content">We had the opportunity to interview a parent, a teacher, a nutritionist, and a school food supplier and conducted a field study at the Central Kitchen, where all of the food for Pittsburgh's elementary schools is cooked and packaged. From this, we gathered three key insights:
            <ol>
              <li>Access, convenience, and lack of money prevent people from eating healthy. A lot of this can be solved, if not for politics.</li>
              <li>"Gatekeepers", like parents and schools, have more influence over what children eat than children do.</li>
              <li>The school food program does not have a lot of money flowing within the ecosystem. If we were to disrupt this, the economic inflow would have to be from elsewhere.</li>
            </ol>
          </p>
          <div class="entry-content"><img class="entry-image" src="img/digestible/centralkitchen.PNG" /></div>
          <h3>IDEATION</h3>
          <p class="entry-content">We began brainstorming service ideas in an affinity diagram that could help the two personas we created: (1) Amy, a mother who feels helpless since she tries to have her kids eat healthy at home but realizes she has no control over their actions and food habits between the time they leave for school and return home, and (2) Joe, a 12-year-old who wishes he could eat healthier, but often turns to food that tastes good and is quick, as he often resorts to his easy option of a can of coke, chips, and a Chipotle bowl. </p>
          <!--<div class="entry-content"><img class="entry-image" src="img/digestible/affinitydiagram.PNG" /></div>-->
          <p class="entry-content">We narrowed down our ideas to three that we selected to storyboard and speed date: public dashboards, advertising, and grocery health scores. During speed dating, we shared a survey on /r/fitness, /r/nutrition, and /r/loseit asking Redditors to provide feedback on each storyboard and say if it was a solution they needed or would use. We also randomly spoke with individuals outside of two Pittsburgh grocery stores to get their thoughts.</p>
          <p class="entry-content">From our intial storyboarding and speed dating, we decided to focus our second round of storyboarding on the themes of access and knowledge. We also decided that the goal of preventing childhood obesity might be out of scope for the project, and decided to broaden our scope to a more &quot;help people eat better&quot; before focusing on a new, smaller idea. 
         <div class="entry-content"><img class="entry-image" src="img/digestible/storyboard6.PNG"></div>
         <div class="entry-content"><img class="entry-image" src="img/digestible/storyboard8.PNG"></div>
         <div class="entry-content"><img class="entry-image" src="img/digestible/storyboard9.PNG"></div>
          <p class="entry-content">The final findings we found from speed dating the new storyboards were than most people did not own smartphones, laptops, or have internet access, so we needed to rethink our target audience because technology is not a solution for everyone. Addtionally, though the ideas were well-received, there was a lot of doubt on whether grocery stores would implement the ideas we suggested. <b>We needed to further explore what value our service could provide to grocery stores</b></p>
          <h3>USER ENACTMENT</h3>
          <p class="entry-content">Individuals from speed dating gave the ideas of grocery store pre-labeling and recipt health scores the high rating in the Need and Useful categories, so our team performed a user enactment in the classroom to test it.</p>
          <p class="entry-content">We invited a shopper to "shop" in our grocery store that contained different foods with labels indicating if a food should be eaten rarely or often. The shopper was presented with a receipt containing a health score at the end based on what he purchased with the $20 budget given to him.</p>
          <div class="entry-content"><img class="entry-image" src="img/digestible/userenactment.PNG" /></div>
          <p class="entry-content">The enactment helped us remember that shoppers make <b>impulse buys</b>. The shopper commented that the <b>shock appeal</b> of a grocery health score might wear out after the first few purchases.</p>
          <h3>CONCEPT PIVOT</h3>
          <p class="entry-content">Coming out of everything with many new insights and ideas, we recognized a need to narrow down our target user and think about the business value proposition that our service would offer to stakeholders.</p>
          <div class="entry-content"><br/><br/><img class="entry-image" src="img/digestible/bigtext.PNG" /><br/><br/></div>
          <p class="entry-content">We realized that there was a problem space that existed where people were in poor health and had the capacity to improve their health with a change in diet.</p>
          <p class="entry-content">This is when doctors came into the picture and patients emerged from our general target because a macro perspective of food purchases could give a more holistic picture of a person's health. <b>We wanted to provide doctors with year-round health data.</b></p>
          <p class="entry-content">At the same time, we thought about how we could make sense of this data for the consumer who could learn to make changes to their diet. <b>We wanted to help consumers understand their shopping/food purchase behavior and help suggest incremental improvements</b></p>
          <p class="entry-content">From this, we formed three new personas based on three key stakeholders: doctor, grocery store/restaurant, and patient/consumer.</p>
          <div class="entry-content"><img class="entry-image" src="img/digestible/persona.PNG" /></div>
          <h3>SERVICE MODELS</h3>
          <p class="entry-content">Thinking about the needs and interactions of Dr. Herman, Alan, and Brian in mind, we modeled the new service.</p>
          <div class="entry-content"><img class="entry-image" src="img/digestible/system.PNG" /></div>
          <div class="entry-content"><img class="entry-image" src="img/digestible/value.PNG" /></div>
          <div class="entry-content"><img class="entry-image" src="img/digestible/stakeholder.PNG" /></div>
          <h3>DESIGN</h3>
          <p class="entry-content">We brainstormed potential user stories and decided to use the story of a high-risk individual with heart disease to demonstrate the value of Digestible and use a single workflow that as the focus during our design phase.</p>
          <!--<div class="entry-content"><img class="entry-image" src="img/digestible/design.PNG" /></div>-->
          <p class="entry-content">After deciding the screens our application would contain based on the functionality we wished to provide, our team thought about how to visualize grocery purchase information in terms of nutrition.</p>
          <p class="entry-content">From testing the screens we sketched, we learned that the <b>strength of our app was in providing users with recommendations of healthy alternatives</b>, and not in displaying data. In providing these recommendations, we recognized that behavior is hard to change--it's difficult to tell someone to give up chips and eat broccoli instead. Because of this, we demonstrated the substitution of frozen corn for canned corn, which is an easy change for a healthier diet.</p>
          <div class="entry-content"><img class="entry-image" src="img/digestible/ui1.jpg" />
          <div class="entry-content"><img class="entry-image" src="img/digestible/ui2.jpg" /></div>
          <p class="entry-content">After testing and finalizing our wireframe, we began focusing on our branding and conduction a visual language and logo exploration. We decided on the final scheme and logo with the help of Reddit's votes on what they felt best fitted out service.</p>
          <div class="entry-content"><img class="entry-image" src="img/digestible/brand.PNG" /></div>
          <h3>FINAL PROTOTYPE</h3>

          <h3>FUTURE WORK</h3>
          <p class="entry-content">I learned a lot about how models are a great visual to use during design discussions and to receive critique and thoughts from key stakeholders. If we were able to spend more time working on the project, there are a few design and technical goals we would want to fulfill in order to further enhance the user experience:
            <ol>
              <li><i>Interview doctors and build out their side of the service.</i> We envision building a web interface that would incorporate with existing electronic records, highlighting improvements since the patient's last visit or problem points during the year.<br /></li>
              <li><i>Conceptualize services within grocery shopping data.</i> Ideas that rose during ideation included fulfillment services, like having grocery stores partner with doctors to provide patients with personalized food baskets for their diet needs that could be easily picked up or delivered.<br /></li>
              <li><i>Explore potential use cases of the data outside of this domain.</i> Grocery purchases can be applied to different services, such as fulfillment or training programs.</li>
            </ol>
