          <h3>CHALLENGE</h3>
          <p class="entry-content">Elders want to use technology in their daily lives, but they want to learn interactively and in a way they can understand. Online video tutorials, phone calls to customer service, and gadget handbooks are incompatible with how seniors learn since it can be difficult to use technology in order to learn technology. Because of this, seniors often rely on family members to help with technology problems or they steer clear of using technology altogether.</p>
          <div class="entry-content"><img class="entry-image" src="img/geekline/1howitworks.PNG" /></div>
          <p class="entry-content">Our solution is to create a marketplace that connects elders with tech mentors who hold face-to-face workshops in local community locations like the public library, YMCA, or JCC. We wanted to make sure it was as easy as possible for community organizations to offer Geekline lessons, so from their side, all they have to do select a time, place, and lesson plan.</p>

          <h3>RESEARCH AND PROCESS</h3>
          <p class="entry-content">A competitive analysis to see what solutions were currently available, online survey to see what problems and concerns the loved ones of elders had, and user interviews with elders at retirement homes in Pittsburgh revealed that different segments of elders exist. Some are very well off and just don't understand technology because they never used it before. Others were not in great health, so health complications like diminishing eyesight prevented them from interacting with a screen.</p>
          <div class="entry-content"><img class="entry-image" src="img/geekline/process.PNG" /></div>
          <p class="entry-content">Focusing on the first group of well-to-do elders, we returned to the retirement homes we had interviewed at earlier to speed date our storyboards that depicted solutions of how elders could learn to use technology.</p>

          <div class="entry-content"><img class="entry-image" src="img/geekline/3speeddate1.PNG"></div>
          <div class="entry-content"><img class="entry-image" src="img/geekline/3speeddatesheet.png"></div>
          <div class="entry-content"><img class="entry-image" src="img/geekline/3speeddatesheet2.png"></div>
          <div class="entry-content"><img class="entry-image" src="img/geekline/3speeddatesheet3.png"></div>
          <div class="entry-content"><img class="entry-image" src="img/geekline/3speeddatesheet4.png"></div>
          <div class="entry-content"><img class="entry-image" src="img/geekline/3speeddatesheet5.png"></div>

          <p class="entry-content">From speed dating, we learned that elders enjoy having access to information and want to learn to use technology through human interaction, as many of the elders we spoke with did not see their families often and no longer had too many friends present in their lives. They also wish to be less dependent on others and have fear of security.</p>

          <h3>VALUE/REVENUE PROPOSITION</h3>
          <p class="entry-content">We envisioned a service that would make it easier for people to help elders learn technology and become engaged with technology by creating a platform where tech mentors, whether volunteer or paid, could sign up to help elders with specific technology learning tasks. By acting as a B2B platform, community organizations can sign up with Geekline to hold workshops that elders could attend. There are multiple other stakeholders and sources of funding. The following image depicts the flow of value and revenue.</p>
          <div class="entry-content"><img class="entry-image" src="img/geekline/2valueflow.PNG"/></div>
          <p class="entry-content">Geekline provides value to elders by solving their problem regarding understanding of technology. Elders have a desire to learn more about technology, and many elders own technology devices such as e-readers, tablet computers, smart phones, and other types of computers. Elders also expressed a desire to receive personal attention either in in-person or voice conversation contexts. (In other words, text-based or video tutorials don't do it for them.)</p>
          <p class="entry-content">At the same time, we saw a market for "tech mentors" who could befriend elders, as students in middle school and high school are encouraged to volunteer. This solution solves the tech mentors' problem of either wanting money or receiving volunteer credits. Community organizations and elders' loved ones receive value by providing the value to the elder via the service.</p>

          <h3>OUTCOME</h3>
          <p class="entry-content">User enactments for training tech mentors on how to get started with Geekline and how to treat elders, along with enactments on holding workshops with elders and creating lesson plans that were easy to understand were received positively. Especially from the enactment with seniors, our team confirmed that human interaction is crucial in the learning process for elders. Many commented that they loved having someone new to talk with and that they looked forward to seeing the volunteer tech mentors again.</p>
          <div class="entry-content"><img class="entry-image" src="img/geekline/4prototype.PNG" /></div>
          <p class="entry-content">Our team created a prototype for the mobile application that the tech mentor would be able to use to access lesson plans and scheduling on Flinto.</p>

          </div>

          <p class="entry-content">Due to time contraints, we were only able to create a prototype of the mobile application for a tech mentor. If I were able to continue working on the project, I would begin fleshing out the web application that community organizations would log into to book workshops held at their location.</p>
