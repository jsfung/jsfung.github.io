For me, it all started in middle school. That was when I watched my first Korean drama, My Girl, and little did I know, this drama would pull me into the world of dramas, variety shows, and music. Watching these shows literally transported me to different countries that I had never visited before. For just a few hours each week, I was able to travel to Korea and eat ddukbokki at a roadside foodstand with my oppa or experience the fun of Golden Week as a high school student in Japan. From my couch at home, I was able to be entertained by a plethora of stories about different types of period from different time periods living different in different cultures, opening my eyes to the way people on the other side of the globe live. I think it's incredible that DramaFever has the power to provide this culture immersion experience to users all around the world, and I would love the opportunity to improve that experience.

I would love to dash into the challenges presented to DramaFever and learn the idiosyncratic details of a user's feelings and behaviors to design solutions with seamless experiences. I am very motivaed and a hard worker, and with my skills in ideating and empathizing with users, I believe I would be a huge asset to the UX team at DramaFever.
